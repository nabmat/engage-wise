                <section class="mission">
                    <p>Our mission is to provide the most context-relevant, evidence-based resource for improving
                        recruitment, retention, and representation in health and care research. We do this by
                        maintaining high editorial standards and a transparent approach to curating, reviewing, and
                        presenting scientific literature. Our team includes methodologists, behavioural scientists, and
                        researchers with lived experience in trial delivery — all of whom are committed to surfacing
                        insights that are both rigorous and practical.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="approach">
                    <p>We do not promote off-the-shelf solutions. Instead, Intelligent Insights offers a clear and
                        nuanced synthesis of the peer-reviewed research, tailored to your study's design, population,
                        and setting. Our aim is to help you design participant-centred research — not just to improve
                        recruitment metrics, but to strengthen quality, ethics, and equity.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="principles">
                    <p>We categorically avoid sensationalism, unsupported claims, or inflated promises. Our users are
                        trial managers, clinical academics, and operational leads who require accurate, up-to-date, and
                        actionable information. We respect that responsibility.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="transparency">
                    <h2>Independence and Transparency</h2>
                    <p>We do not accept paid content or advertising, and our research outputs are not influenced by
                        external sponsors. All literature reviews, recommendations, and recommendations are produced
                        internally or by commissioned academics under strict editorial independence. No commercial
                        entity may alter or influence the findings we publish.</p>
                    <p>Our editorial team declares no financial conflicts of interest related to participant recruitment
                        services or platforms. Where we collaborate with trusted partners (e.g., designers or vendors),
                        this is clearly indicated, and recommendations are based on quality, not commission.</p>

                <section class="content-review">
                    <h2>Content Development and Review</h2>
                    <p>Every strategy or intervention featured on Intelligent Insights is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Systematically sourced from published, peer-reviewed literature.</li>
                        <li>Reviewed by a human behavioural scientist or clinical trials methodologist.</li>
                        <li>Mapped to relevant study contexts (e.g., rare disease, primary care, underserved
                            populations).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each summary goes through multiple stages of quality assurance — including scoping, extraction,
                        synthesis, and readability checks. We do not summarise content until full papers are reviewed in
                        context.</p>
                    <p>As Intelligent Insights grows, we will invite community input to strengthen our content and
                        transparency, including version histories, user reviews, and direct links to source papers.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="updates">
                    <h2>Updates and Corrections</h2>
                    <p>We regularly review and update our database to reflect new evidence, guideline changes, and user
                        feedback. If you believe you've found an error or wish to challenge an interpretation, we
                        welcome your input.</p>
                    <p>Corrections are made transparently and promptly, and our aim is to become the most trusted,
                        accurate, and context-sensitive source of recruitment evidence in clinical research.</p>
